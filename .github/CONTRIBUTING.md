# Contributing
The purpose of this project is to be an intro into open source for any beginners so you can go through the project site here [TextListToHTML](https://jemimaabu.github.io/text-list-to-html/) and then choose something to work on.

I was meant to make the project as bare as possible but I got carried away and pretty much finished the entire thing. Although if you'd like to change something or fix or a bug or whatever, feel free to do so.

## Getting Started
**Step 1**:  Create an issue for the task you want to work on (go through the [Issues](https://github.com/jemimaabu/text-list-to-html/issues) page first to make sure it doesn't already exist) or select an already existing issue to work on.

**Step 2**: Assign the issue to yourself or leave a comment under an existing issue, requesting assignment.

**Step 3**: Fork the repository, create a new branch with the same title as your issue (as long as it's something readable) and make whatever changes you want.

**Step 4**: Create a pull request for the branch.

**Step 5**: Once your PR is approved and merged, the change will be uploaded to the project website.

**Step 6**: Congratulations, you've just contributed to an Open Source Project! Whoopwhoop.
